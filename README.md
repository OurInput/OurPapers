# OurPapers Project

## Description:

The OurPapers project complements OurCharacters by focusing on the user interface and interaction aspects of the OurInput system. Inspired by the fluidity of writing on paper, this project aims to create an intuitive and flexible editor where users can seamlessly integrate both standard text and custom characters created through OurCharacters. This includes developing methods for inputting, displaying, and manipulating mixed content (text and custom symbols) within a single, cohesive document.

## Motivation:

Traditional writing on paper offers a level of freedom and immediacy that is often lost in digital text editors. The ability to effortlessly switch between writing standard characters and drawing or incorporating unique symbols is a key aspect of this freedom.

OurPapers is motivated by the desire to bring this fluidity to the digital realm. We want to create an editor that feels as natural and uninhibited as writing on paper, even when dealing with custom characters. This project will explore innovative UI/UX designs, input methods, and rendering techniques to ensure a seamless experience for users working with a mixture of standard text and their personally created characters. The goal is to make the act of digital creation feel less like typing on a machine and more like expressing thoughts freely on a digital canvas.
